Our study explored a more affordable alternative: using oviposition traps (ovitraps), which collect mosquito eggs instead of adults. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, we 
compared data from eggs collected in ovitraps with data from standard mosquito traps (BG-traps) that catch adult mosquitoes. By analyzing the mosquitoes for Wolbachia, 
we found that the egg-based method provided reliable estimates of Wolbachia levels in the mosquito population. 

The main analysis can be found in the Ovitrap_vs_BGtrap_BH.Rmd file. All data used in this analysis was blinded at the cluster-level, to maintain the author's blinding
for the ongoing EVITA Dengue Trial (DMID 17-0111). The blinded trap-level results of Wolbachia detection for the two trap types can be found in the ovitrap_results.csv 
and bgtrap_results.csv files. A description of the variables in the these files can be found in the Variables_Description.docx file.
